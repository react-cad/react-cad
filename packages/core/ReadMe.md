# @react-cad/core

Core @react-cad WebAssembly library, providing primitives for constructing the shape tree and a viewer to render shape trees into an HTML canvas.

The viewer code is derived from the [Open CASCADE WebGL Sample application](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_samples_webgl.html).
