# ReactCAD

## Code solid 3D objects with React

ReactCAD is an open-source 3D modelling system for programmers. Models are written as React components in TypeScript or JavaScript and compiled in the browser by a fast WebAssembly library.

Create your design as code in your favorite editor and view a hot-reloading preview as you work. Export to STEP, BREP or STL, or publish your part to NPM so others can incorporate it into their own models.

Publish to the web on GitHub Pages or your own hosting - visitors can view, customize and export your model directly from the browser without downloading any software.

> **ReactCAD is in pre-alpha and likely to contain bugs.** It is not yet feature complete and the API is subject to change. See the <Link to="roadmap">roadmap</Link> for progress and planned features.

Learn how to create your first component on the <Link to="getting-started">Getting Started</Link> page, or view live examples in the <Link to="reference-introduction">Reference</Link> section.

_**NEW:**_ You can now try ReactCAD online in the [ReactCAD Playground](https://react-cad.github.io/playground)!

<Example
  imgSrc={part}
  code={`
<difference>
  <box x={12} y={12} z={1} />
  <translation x={3} y={3}>
    <cylinder height={1} radius={1} />
  </translation>
  <translation x={9} y={3}>
    <cylinder height={1} radius={1} />
  </translation>
  <translation x={3} y={9}>
    <cylinder height={1} radius={1} />
  </translation>
  <translation x={9} y={9}>
    <cylinder height={1} radius={1} />
  </translation>
</difference>
`}

ReactCAD is free software and is made possible by other great open-source projects. The core geometry library is built in C++ with [Open CASCADE](https://dev.opencascade.org/). A [React](https://reactjs.org) renderer allows control of the core library from React components. [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) provides the user interface and customization controls. SVG parsing is by [nanosvg](https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg).
