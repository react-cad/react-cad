# Sweeps

ReactCAD provides various elements to construct 3-dimensional solids by sweeping a profile along a spine. Prisms, pipes, revolutions and helices take a 2d shape as a profile and sweep it along a path. Evolutions take a 2d shape as a spine, and sweep a path along it to describe a 3d solid.

The 2d shapes are defined using SVGs drawn onto surfaces which orient them in 3d space.

Most SVGs should work, but the full spec is not supported. In particular;

- text is not supported (text can be extruded by creating an SVG `path` in the shape of the text)
- path stroke and fill attributes are ignored - all shapes are filled.
- self-intersecting shapes cause undefined behaviour.

Also note that the SVG coordinate system is left-handed, while the 3d coordinate system is right-handed, so when rendering SVGs y-coordinates are negated.
