# Sweeps

ReactCAD provides various elements to construct 3-dimensional solids by sweeping a profile along a spine. Prisms, pipes, revolutions and helices take a 2d shape as a profile and sweep it along a path. Evolutions take a 2d shape as a spine, and sweep a path along it to describe a 3d solid.

The 2d shapes are defined using SVGs drawn onto surfaces which orient them in 3d space. See <Link to="reference-surfaces-svgs--introduction">Surfaces & SVGs</Link>.
