# sphericalSurface

The `sphericalSurface` element orients its SVG children on the surface of a sphere. The `radius` prop specifies the radius of the sphere. By default the sphere is at the origin but an optional `origin` prop can translate the surface.

Co-ordinates in the x-direction range from 0 to 2π. Co-ordinates in the y-direction range from -π/2 to π/2.

<ArgsTable
  rows={{
    radius: {
      name: "radius",
      description: "The radius of the spherical surface",
      table: {
        type: {
          summary: "number",
        },
      },
    },
    origin: {
      name: "origin",
      description: "The position of the surface's origin in 3d space.",
      table: {
        type: {
          summary: "[number, number, number]",
          detail: "a vector [x,y,z]",
        },
      },
    },
  }}

## Examples

export const SphericalSurface = (props) => <sphericalSurface {...props} />;

### Spherical surface

An SVG in a spherical surface with radius 1, located at the origin.

`ReactIcon` is a React component which returns an SVG element. Its `width` and `height` props are passed to the SVG, and in conjunction with the SVG's `viewBox` prop they cause the shape to be scaled to fit within the sphere's co-ordinate system.

<Source
  language="jsx"
  code={`<sphericalSurface>
  <ReactIcon width={Math.PI * 0.75} height={Math.PI * 0.75}/>
</sphericalSurface>
`}
/>

<Story
  name="sphericalSurface"
  args={{
    children: <ReactIcon width={Math.PI * 0.75} height={Math.PI * 0.75} />,
  }}
>
  {SphericalSurface.bind({})}
</Story>

### Large, translated spherical surface

An SVG in a spherical surface with radius 20, raised above the origin.

<Source
  language="jsx"
  code={`<sphericalSurface radius={20} origin={[0,0,10]}>
  <ReactIcon width={40} height={40}/>
</sphericalSurface>
`}
/>

<Story
  name="large-sphericalSurface"
  args={{
    radius: 20,
    origin: [0, 0, 10],
    children: <ReactIcon width={40} height={40} />,
  }}
>
  {SphericalSurface.bind({})}
</Story>
