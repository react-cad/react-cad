# Surfaces & SVGs

ReactCAD provides various elements to construct 3-dimensional solids from flat shapes. These elements are documented in the <Link to="reference-constructions--introduction">constructions</Link> section. The flat shapes themselves are defined by drawing SVG shapes onto surfaces.

SVGs work the same as they do in React for the web. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">the MDN SVG reference</a> for SVG documentation.

The full spec is not supported. In particular;

- text is not supported (text can be created using an SVG `path` in the shape of the text),
- path stroke and fill attributes are ignored - all shapes are filled,
- self-intersecting shapes cause undefined behaviour.

SVGs are only valid inside a surface. SVGs don't have a meaning outside surfaces - SVGs provide the paths that make up shapes, but surfaces provide the co-ordinate system that orients those paths in space. No other element but SVGs are allowed inside surfaces.
