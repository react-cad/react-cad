# svg

SVGs work the same as they do in React for the web. Any SVG element can be used. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">the MDN SVG reference</a> for SVG documentation.

Many SVGs will work, but the full spec is not supported. In particular;

- text is not supported (text can be created using an SVG `path` in the shape of the text),
- path stroke and fill attributes are ignored - all shapes are filled,
- self-intersecting shapes cause undefined behaviour.

SVGs are only valid inside a surface. SVGs don't have a meaning outside surfaces - SVGs provide the paths that make up shapes, but surfaces provide the co-ordinate system that orients those paths in space.

## Examples

export const Plane = (props) => <planar {...props} />;

### Plane at the origin

An SVG in the xy-plane at the origin.

<Source
  language="jsx"
  code={`<planar>
  <ReactIcon /> {/* ReactIcon is a React component which returns an SVG */
</planar>
`}
/>

<Story name="plane">
  <planar>
    <svg>
      <circle cx={3} cy={3} r={2} />
    </svg>
  </planar>
</Story>

### Translated plane

An SVG in a flat plane raised above the xy-plane.

<Source
  language="jsx"
  code={`<planar origin={[30, 20, 10]}>
  <ReactIcon />
</planar>
`}
/>

<Story
  name="translated-plane"
  args={{
    origin: [30, 20, 10],
    children: <ReactIcon />,
  }}
>
  {Plane.bind({})}
</Story>
