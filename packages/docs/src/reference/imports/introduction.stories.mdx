# Imports

ReactCAD provides various elements to import models created in other CAD programs. ReactCAD operates on exact geometry, so BREP and STEP file formats that preserve exact geometry are preserved. STL and OBJ imports are provided for compatibility, but as mesh formats they will be less accurate and slow to work with.
