# polyhedron

The `polyhedron` element creates an arbitrary polyhedron. It takes an array of `points` and an array of `faces`. Each point is a 3 element array of x-, y- and z-coordinates. Each face is an array of indices into the `points` array, describing a polygon with vertices at those points. The faces must be planar and combine to fully enclose a part of 3d space.

<ArgsTable
  rows={{
    points: {
      name: "points",
      type: {
        required: true,
      },
      description: "An array of points in 3d space",
      table: {
        type: {
          summary: "[number, number, number]",
          detail: "a tuple of x-, y- and z-coordinates",
        },
      },
    },
    faces: {
      name: "faces",
      type: {
        required: true,
      },
      description: "An array of faces, each of which is an array of indices into the `points` array, so as to describe a polygon with vertices at those points. Faces must be planar and fully enclose a part of 3d space.",
      table: {
        type: {
          summary: "number[][]",
          detail: "an array of arrays of numbers",
        },

    },

## Examples

export const Polyhedron = (props) => <polyhedron {...props} />;
